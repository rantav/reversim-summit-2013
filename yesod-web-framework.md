Title: Yesod Web Framework for Haskell
==========================
The Yesod Web Framework is designed around a central tenet: bringing the advantages of the Haskell programming language to the world of web development. As such, compile-time safety, high performance, and simple concurrency are first-class features in the framework, all inherited directly from Haskell. In this talk, we will look at these advantages through actual code and show how Haskell and Yesod can help you produce better applications.
