Cost Aware Architecture
===

A lot of us run our services in the cloud these days. We are billed for actual usage with a very fine granularity of $/hour.
When we design our architectures we usually take into account scalability and survivability of the services. In some cases we even talk about efficiency to make sure response times are adequate.

However, most of us don't factor in cost into the original architecture and when things starts to get expensive (which is good - because you are growing) - rearchitecting is hard and sometimes even fatal.

In this talk we will cover some cost numbers and how they scale as well as try to highlight points you should consider when architecting your system today which will help you save a lot of money when the happy time comes and traffic starts to pour in by the bucket.

Eran has been thinking quite a lot (some even say obssesed) about the cloud and how to factor in cost as part of it. He is also part of the lool Ventures incubation team - testing ideas and spinning some of them to full blown companies such as:
Familio (http://familio.com), MyPermissions (https://mypermissions.com | http://mypermissions.org) and soon SharePops (http://sharepops.com) which recently won first place in AngelHack TLV.
