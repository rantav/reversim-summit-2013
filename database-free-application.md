Database free Applications
==========================
Usually applications are designed to have some sort of data storage and set it's
logic accordingly.
Many times, there are more then one application that does the same thing with 
the same data, but not always the same database.
In this lecture I'm going to explain how to notice such problems, and designing
a better program without the database itself, and also figuring out when you 
really need a database and when it's an "over killed" feature.
