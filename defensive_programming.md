Title: Defensive Programming - I know what you did last sprint?
================================================================

People have a lot of approaches when developing their own code, and when looking at existing code.
In this talk I will discuss I call "defensive programming" (not the [secure programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming) you might know from other places), 
and how I see it affecting your team and the strength of your code
