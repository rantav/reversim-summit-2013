Lab: Java Production Debugging 101 
==================================
One of the unfortunate truths of software development is that, sooner or later, shit hits the fan and something breaks on production. The Java platform (and the JDK specifically) has a whole set of debugging and analysis tools that can be used to diagnose a large variety of production issues with no prior setup and nothing but SSH access to the server and a bit of common sense.

This lab will focus on common Java server production issues (including deadlocks, memory leaks and thread starvation), and introduce some of these tools by demonstrating how they can be used to analyze and resolve each scenario.

================
Tomer Gabel has an unending fascination with software engineering, and believes that the only way to get better is to share what he knows. He currently leads the data acquisition team at [newBrandAnalytics](http://www.newbrandanalytics.com) where he enjoys working with [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and tackling large-scale infrastructure challenges. Before that he formed the DevOps group at [Sears Israel](http://sears.co.il/) and worked on a whole bunch of software projects at Delver, Monfort Software Engineering and the IDF.

An active participant in several user groups (primarily [JJTV](http://www.meetup.com/jjtv-il/)) and an Israeli [demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) veteran, Tomer is quite confident that software development will never be boring.
