Introduction to Storm
=====================
[Storm](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm) is a distributed and fault-tolerant system for doing realtime computations. 

Released as FOSS by Twitter, it gained the nickname "Realtime Hadoop" by providing an elegant solution to a problem hunting those of us who process gargantuan amount of bits: having results as fast as possible (faster than batch processing would allow.)

I'm going to show how and why Storm is the piece you are missing, and how it provides a _simple_, _reliable_, and _fun_ framework for streaming computations that helps you keep your results fresh, just like it already does in the [many production environments](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/wiki/Powered-By) already powered by it.
