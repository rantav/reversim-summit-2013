Testing for the common developers
=================================

Most developers know the ins and outs of unit tests, but why are integration tests less common? what makes it so hard to write integration/acceptance/smoke tests? why does the QA automation requires tight integration with the development team?
I'd like to share my experience after researching a dozen of different tools (open source and commercial) with different paradigms (Selenium is different form EggPlant as functional languages differ from imperative ones).
In this talk I'll present most tools available for both functional tests, and UI testing. I'll explain the history, failing buzz (e.g. KDD) and best practices.

P.S. Some claim the title should be "Tests. What are they good for?"

Before falling in love with client side programming, I had a romance with Machine Learning (Spring diagnostics), a long relationship with Distributed computing (IBM's High Availability Team), a crush for compilers (on the e programming language at Cadence), and a fling with Browser Extensions.
My last job was helping build the Wix MVC framework (for Wix's special needs).
I currently hold the position of Director of R&D at Applitools, with a disruptive product which makes my dream of automatic testing come true.
