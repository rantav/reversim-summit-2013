# Better Products Through Typography

I gave this talk at a local UX meetup last June, to about 30 people. It was well-received, here’s the [slide deck is online](https://speakerdeck.com/idangazit/better-products-through-typography).

**I’d prefer you pick my datavis talk over this one.**

## Abstract

If you’re building a product, a little bit of good typography can have a _lot_ of impact. We invest a ton of effort engineering solutions that improve our products—better caching, more efficient databases, partial pageloads for faster rendering. As developers, we often ignore the non-engineering improvements we can make to our products because we don’t know enough about them.

Design is a discipline, and every developer should know a little bit about it—just like you know a little bit about many topics that impact the products you are building. Design is just another tool in your development toolbox.

Whether you are building products for the screen or for print, type is often the main channel of communication between your product and your users. Modern typography has a rich history dating back to the invention of movable type in 1450 A.D., but many lessons were lost when type made the jump to the screen. The talk will be  a mix of theory and practical advice on using type to direct and delight users' brains.
