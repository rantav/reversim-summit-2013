Ember.js for Large Scale Applications
=====================================
Ember brings a paradigm shift when it comes to MVC frameworks. Its Apple origin gave it all the advantages of a robust (native like) framework dedicated for large scale applications, while recent changes added sugar making it easier to learn.
This lecture is not just for new Embers, but also for those familiar with her, and wish to have a deeper understanding, ramping up their skills with best practices.

Included topics:
  * Fundamentals
    - The big picture - How Ember sees MVC (who does what).
    - Object Binding - Where the magic happens.

  * Advanced Views
    - Binding Views to stuff, what happens under the hood.
    - Handling native events (and custom events).
    - TDD is simpler using Ember.. let me prove it.
   
  * Best practices - Creating big apps using small Web Components.

  * Ember's Model(Data) System - Automatic REST Serialization.
  * Ember's Routing - Automatic sync of URL and application state
    
  * The run loop - when is what updated.

  * Pitfalls - Ember's Gotchas

Before falling in love with client side programming, I had a romance with Machine Learning (Spring diagnostics), a long relationship with Distributed computing (IBM's High Availability Team), a crush for compilers (on the e programming language at Cadence), and a fling with Browser Extensions.
My last job was helping build the Wix MVC framework (for Wix's special needs).
I currently hold the position of Director of R&D at Applitools, with a disruptive product which makes my dream of automatic testing come true.
