Kenshoo and the GreenPlum - Big Data DWH
=========================================================

All about the tale of Kenshoo's adventures when building a datawarehouse for big-data. 

* What people do you need for this type of journey?
* What tools are available, and which are best suited?
* Should you go through the paid commercial fast road, or try the yellow brick open source path?

* and most importantly.... why go anyways?

In this talk I will describe the experience we had with scaling our click tracking system using a no-sql solution (cassandra) and consoloditing our reporting data using GreenPlum DWH.
