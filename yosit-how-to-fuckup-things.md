Title: How To Fuckup
====================

Fucking things up is a kind of a science. In the session I'll talk about SOME of the fuckups I was to blame. I will share best practices on how to loose all your money, How to get fired really fast, How to achieve unfundability and How to NOT sell your company when someone really really wants to give you lots of money for it.
