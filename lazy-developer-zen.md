Lazy Developer Zen
===

A lazy developer is not a bad developer. A lazy developer think things through and tries to focus energy on the things that matters, as opposed to those that do not.
The lazy developer tries to produce maximum value with the least amount of effort and energy.

The vehicles through which the Lazy Developer reach enlightenment are tools, methods and techniques we can all learn and use.
We will try to cover some of these tools and methods in this talk and hopefully, you will all get a little bit lazy after it.
