Title: How we took our server-side application to the Cloud and liked what we got
==========================
Taking traditional Java server-side applications to the multi-tenant Cloud introduces lots of challenges. In this session, we will share our experience of creating a SaaS offering, which is currently being used successfully by the Java community. We will start by reviewing the challenges we faced during the SaaS conversion. Next, we will share our experience with the EC2 platform. We will discuss the importance of automation and how we use tools like Chef and Puppet for SaaS provisioning. Finally, we will describe how creating a SaaS version of our product shifted our way of thinking about software release. We will recommend what’s required to successfully release both SaaS and downloadable versions of your product.
