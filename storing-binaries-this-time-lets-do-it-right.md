Title: Storing binaries - this time let’s do it right
==========================
So, you tried with your subversion/git/cvs. Huge checkouts, versions got lost. Next, you tired with your file server. Tons of manual work, lack of control. You didn’t try to send them by mail, did you? Good. There is a better and smarter way to do it.
Join us to hear more about binary repository managers and how they can improve your life - your version control system, file server and your fellow developers will thank you.
