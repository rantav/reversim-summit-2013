# Modern Stack of Today's Web Applications

The stack we use to buid today's web applications is very different from what we used just a short 5 years ago.

Where once Perl/PHP with Apache and Mysql (the ubiquitous LAMP stack) ruled the works today the field is much more diverse.

Node.js running in cloud, real time applications using push technologies,
NoSQL, CoffeeScript, client side rendering, Backbone.js, Ember.js. Rails, Python, Go, Scala, Clojure.  How we
go about creating awesome web applications today using the right tool for the
job.
