# Introduction to Rails

Many (most?) of your heard about Rails, but not everyone still know what is it
exactly and what is all the buzz about.

I'm going to present the main ideas behind rails, code examples, and community
values. Hopefully I can convince you to invest more time into it and learn it
as it is one of the best tools on the market today to build web applications.

Also we will have a pick on what the shiny new Rails 4.0 is about to change in
the way we develop web apps today.
