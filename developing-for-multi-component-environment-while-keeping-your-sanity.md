Title: Developing for multi-component environment while keeping your sanity
==========================
Managing a modern multi-component application in a continuous integration/deployment environment can be very tricky. In this session we will concentrate on two of the aspects - environment setup, showcasing tools like Vagrant, Chef and Puppet for creating and controlling development, testing, staging, production and other environments and pushing the deliverables through those environments, using tools like Gradle, Jenkins and Artifactory. Join us and get all the little tips and tricks that will help you rule your development world.
