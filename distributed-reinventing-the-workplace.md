Distributed: Reinventing the Workplace
==============================================================
A company without offices? Employees from all around the world? Working without pants? This surely must be _The Future_, and Automattic - the company behind WordPress.com -  has been living it since 2005. Join me to learn how more than 130 employees from over 24 countries collaborate to make the web a better place.
This talk will cover communication tools and methods, hiring and onboarding process, continuous deployment, and the general awesomeness of the distributed company.

A jack of all trades, I'm a self-taught developer and a strong believer in open source. Almost four years now at Automattic, I'm currently supporting our support team by building tools and refining processes. I'm a core contributor to WordPress, and can often be seen passionately talking about it at various WordCamps and WordPress meetups.
