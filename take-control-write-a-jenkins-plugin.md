Title: Take control, write a Jenkins Plugin!
==========================
Plugins are a crucial part of Jenkins CI and have become a prominent backbone of the community. Almost every team's got an "itch to scratch" in their build routine and, as will be demonstrated in this talk, creating a powerful plugin has never been easier.
We will start with the basics - overview of plugin capabilities, we will write extension point, will create additions to UI, working our way to more advanced aspects of plugin development, such as working with remote agents, working in multiple operation systems, creating UI using Groovy and extending UI components.
