Testing and Refactoring Legacy Code
===================================
Java has been around since 1995 and many of us are now working with large Java systems which have grown very complex and with no or very few tests. In this live coding session, Sandro will be demonstrating some techniques that will help us overcome the most common challenges of testing legacy Java code and also what we need to have in mind when refactoring towards a better design. Although he will be using Java, the techniques presented can be applied to any Object-Oriented language.
