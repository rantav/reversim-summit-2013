The Nemerle Programming Language - CLR on Steroids
===
The Nemerle programming language is a multi-paradigm language built on top of the CLR, that takes .NET to the next level! While it resembles C#, Nemerle goes beyond C# by incorporating extremely powerful features like metaprogramming out of the box, strong pattern matching and incredibly powerful macros, Nemerle is able to perform tasks that are either impossible (or very hard to do) in other CLR languages, like C#!

In this talk you will learn:

* Introduction to the Nemerle programming language
* The 'C# way' vs 'Nemerle way'
* Key features: type inference, pattern matching, metaprogramming
* Macros - extending the language on the fly
