Big Data In the Cloud
==================================
Adopting Hadoop to manage your Big Data is an important step, but not the end-solution to your Big Data challenges. Here are some of the additional considerations you must face:
 
1. Choosing the right cloud for the job: The massive computing and storage resources that are needed to support Big Data applications make cloud environments an ideal fit, and more than ever, there is a growing number of choices of cloud infrastructure types and providers. Given the diverse options, and the dynamic environments involved, it becomes ever more important to maintain the flexibility for all your IT needs.

2. Big Data is a complex beast: It involves many and different moving parts, in large clusters, and is continually growing and evolving. Managing such an environment manually is not a viable option. The question is, how can you achieve automation of all this complexity?

3. The world beyond Hadoop: Big Data is not just Hadoop – there is a whole rapidly growing ecosystem to contend with, including NoSQL, data  processing, analytics tools… As well as your own application services. How can you manage deployment, configuration, scaling and failover of all the different pieces, in a consistent way?

 
In this session, you'll learn how to deploy and manage your Hadoop cluster on any Cloud, as well as manage the rest of your big data application stack using a new open source framework called [Cloudify](http://cloudifysource.org).
