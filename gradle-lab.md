Title: Gradle Lab
=================

This lab introduces [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) build tool that is becoming immensely popular today throughout enterprises and open-source communities.

We'll start from cloning a GitHub project and then go through all major phases of working with Gradle:

* Bootstrapping Gradle using Gradle wrapper (no need to have Gradle installed!)
* Running full build
* Running incremental build
* Building multi-module project
* Building multi-module and multi-language (Java, Groovy, Scala, Kotlin) project
* Running tests
* Adding custom build logic
* Applying third-party build plugins

In conslusion we'll see examples of various [Gradle plugins](https://github.com/evgeny-goldin/gradle-plugins): a plugin to find out duplicate classes in your build dependencies, a plugin to attach textual information to your build artifacts, a plugin to work with Node.js aplications and a plugin to run your builds on various machines without setting up Jenkins slaves or TeamCity build agents.
