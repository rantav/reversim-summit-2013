Title: Gradle 101
===
In this sessions I'll introduce [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) build tool that is becoming immensely popular today throughout enterprises and open-source communities. We'll see what makes Gradle so popular and successful, how it bootstraps itself with Gradle wrapper, decreases your build time with incremental builds and Gradle daemon, interoperates with Scala, Groovy and Kotlin by applying Gradle plugins and makes it possible to easily throw in your build logic with a straightforward Groovy DSL.

In the second part we'll see example of various Gradle plugin I've developed over time: a plugin to find out duplicate classes in your build dependencies, a plugin to attach textual information to your build artifacts, a plugin to work with Node.js aplications and a plugin to run your builds on various machines without setting up Jenkins slaves or TeamCity build agents.
